For a long time I thought that the addition of a ".com" button on the iOS keyboard was a fantastic idea.  But what about .net, .org, and .edu domains?  Where's the love for them?

I got to thinking, wouldn't it be awesome if you could hover over the .com button and get a popup with options for the other common top-level domains?

Turns out the Apple engineers were way ahead of me.  Give it a shot sometime!

On my iPad (set to English/US keyboard layout of course) hovering over the .com button gives me additional options for .net, .org, .us, and .edu.  It does make me wonder if I would get something like .co.uk if I had a British keyboard setting.

What you apparently can NOT do is take a screenshot with the popup menu activated.
