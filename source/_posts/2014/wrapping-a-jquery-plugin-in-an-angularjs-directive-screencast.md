Recently I saw Evil Trout’s screencast [Wrapping a jQuery plugin in an Ember.js component](http://eviltrout.com/2014/06/03/jquery-component.html), and thought that it would be really valuable to show the exact same plugin implemented instead as an AngularJS directive.

I want to be clear that I don’t intend to start some sort of Angular vs. Ember flame war. I happen to believe, as Ben Lesh concludes in his [excellent 6-part blog series comparing the two frameworks](http://www.benlesh.com/2014/04/embular-part-1-comparing-ember-and.html), that Angular and Ember are two paths up the same mountain, and that together they are pushing the state of web development forward.

It’s clear that I need better audio equipment if I intend to keep doing screencasts, but I think it’s passable. I hope you enjoy it!
