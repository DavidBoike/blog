This week I will be speaking at the Twin Cities .NET User Group:

> **Modeling Tricks My Relational Database Never Taught Me**
>  **Date:** Thursday, April 6, 5:30 PM
>  **Location:** ILM Professional Services, 5221 Viking Drive, Edina, MN 55435
>
> In this session we will explore several modeling scenarios from my own experience that can easily be achieved using RavenDB, but difficult (if not nearly impossible) to build using a classic relational database. The focus will be on helping those accustomed to SQL Server or other relational databases learn good document modeling skills by example, with a summary of document modeling guidelines at the end.

As always, my employer ILM Professional Services will be providing the pizza at the meeting.

TCDNUG has recently switched to using [Meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com/tcdnug/events/161392542/) to register for these events, but apparently Meetup has become the [victim of a very sophisticated DDoS attack and is temporarily unavailable](http://meetupblog.meetup.com/post/78413031007/no-doubt-this-has-been-a-tough-weekend-for). Seriously, who does that?

So if you are unable to actually register, **please come anyway**. We would love to see you there!
